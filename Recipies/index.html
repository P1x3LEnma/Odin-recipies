      Momos are a popular dumpling from Tibet, Nepal, and parts of India. They
      start with a dough made from all-purpose flour and water, rolled into thin
      circles.
      <br />
      The filling typically consists of ground meat or finely chopped vegetables
      mixed with spices like ginger, garlic, and soy sauce. <br />
      A spoonful of this mixture is placed on each dough circle.
      <br />
      The dough is then folded and sealed around the filling into pleated
      pouches or half-moon shapes. Momos are usually steamed, though they can
      also be boiled or pan-fried. <br />Served with a spicy dipping sauce, they
      are a savory and aromatic treat enjoyed worldwide.
